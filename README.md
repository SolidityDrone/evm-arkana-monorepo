// NOtice this isnt an agent is my own reasoning xD
NOW sure yet if this DeFi-Punk protocol is meant for humans or for agents o.o 

Since i just discovered I can do that kind of thing @contract/test/DrandTimelockExperiment.t.sol
i'm right now figuring out i'm targeting a different kind of user than i initially intended:
This is not for cyberpunks anymore, but mainly for agents and human traders that want strong privacy while keeping their action
auditable and public to farm reputation scores maybe.

tempPrivacy is born, which is different from pure confidentiality cause you are full shielded with timelock encryption.
This makes you confortable about not having institutions and authorities to snitch and turn into inside trading.

Ideally i wanna keep send/absorb approach, but wanna implement a uniswap integration  with drand that makes it so the user can make twap orders progressively spread in private timlocked chunks || Idk i need a hook here since i'm dealing mostly with token that have much more liq. Would be too illiquid i think to have like a hook for usdc/weth.

For now i'm doing the swap just using uniswap router
