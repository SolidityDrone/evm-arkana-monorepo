Not sure yet if this DeFi-Punk protocol is meant for humans or for agents o.o 

Since i just discovered I can do that kind of thing @contract/test/DrandTimelockExperiment.t.sol
i'm right now figuring out i'm targeting a different kind of user than i initially intended:
This is not for cyberpunks anymore, but mainly for agents and human traders that want strong privacy while keeping their action
auditable and public to farm reputation scores maybe.

tempPrivacy is born, which is different from pure confidentiality cause you are full shielded with timelock encryption.
This makes you confortable about not having institutions and authorities to snitch and turn into inside trading.
